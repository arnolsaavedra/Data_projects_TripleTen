# üìä Business Analytics Project

This project transforms raw e-commerce user activity logs into actionable business insights.
I built a conversion funnel, prepared data for cohort analysis, and calculated retention rates.
Key techniques included pivot tables, date functions, and structured data cleanup.
The final spreadsheet includes a clean executive summary and analysis-ready dashboards.
