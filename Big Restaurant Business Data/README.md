## 🗂️ Data

TripleTen provided a `.zip` archive containing **five Excel files** for the fictional Zomato company. Two of these were the primary sources for analysis:

- `orders.xlsx`: All orders placed by customers across restaurants from Oct 2017 – Jun 2020  
- `users.xlsx`: Demographics of customers who placed those orders

## 📌 Recommendations

Practical Recommendations:
Based on the findings, here are some suggested actions:
- Use more detailed segmentation to tailor offers and campaigns based on education
level, marital status, and gender.
- Run marketing campaigns aimed at young adults with small families and high education
levels.
- Focus on highly educated women as a potentially loyal customer segment.
- Continuously monitor demographic trends to spot shifts in customer profiles over time.
- Incentives should be created for individual orders, as these are the customers who
spend the most.
- Focus should be placed on filtering by customer age, as the analysis shows that people
aged 21, 26, and 33 are the highest consumers. On average, 33-year-olds with a family
group of 5 are the strongest in terms of spending.
