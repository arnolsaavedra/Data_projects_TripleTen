## 📌 Recommendations

- Provide additional training for our tech team so they can better guide customers toward choosing the right products.

- Personally reach out to customers who returned all of their orders to understand what went wrong. If needed, make improvements to the website or review how our shipping partners are handling deliveries.

- As a short-term fix, temporarily pause the sale of products with the highest return rates.

- Internally, prioritize updating product details—especially sizing guides—and encourage customer reviews through social media partnerships or influencer content.

- For regions with particularly high return rates, we could explore options like stricter return policies or a small return fee to offset costs.

- Rethink our promotions—focus on things like free shipping or gift cards during holidays, rather than just offering discounts.
